# Breast-Cancer-Text-Mining
## Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer diagnosed among women and is the second leading cause of cancer death. 3
Approximately 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 63,410 cases of in situ breast carcinoma were expected to be diagnosed among US women in 2017,
and 40,610 women are expected to die from this disease alone.3 Overall, breast cancer mortality rates have decreased by 39%
through 2015 and this is a result of improvement in treatment and detection screening by mammography.3 Cancer is a result of damage (mutation) to a cell’s DNA,
so that the cell loses normal functionality and instead gains the ability to indefinitely multiply until normal tissue functions are impaired.4
Most breast cancers begin in the cells that line the ducts, few start in the cells lining the lobules, and in cells of the other tissues in the breast.1
Cancerous DNA mutations may occur from a complex mixture of inherited and external factors, where these mutations are usually located in cell division genes.4
However, some other risk factors include age, mutation in BRCA1/2 gene, radiation exposure, high breast density, etc.1
It is from all this information that we realize the importance in conducting our study to recognize the trend in diagnosis, prevention, and the treatment of
breast cancer over the last ten years. Our main focus is to understand the progress being made in helping treat breast cancer
by narrowing down what topics specifically have researchers been focusing on and where they overlap. With the amount of articles
out there it is not uncommon for researchers to encounter some new sequences or genes they do not know about.
Text mining is used to discover these knowledge patterns or hypotheses in helping to solve biomedical questions.2
The two major steps are: to identify biomedical entities and concepts of interests from free text using NLP techniques;
and then further analyses are performed to see whether these entities have any relationships.2
Shallow parsing is often used to focus on specific parts of the text to analyze predefined words.2
With the idea of text mining and machine learning, it becomes most relevant to Chapter 6 and 7 of the textbook.
Both of those chapters focused on knowledge discovery life cycle, which involves data preparation, data reduction, and data mining methods.
As well as, approaches to natural language processing and text mining, which involves document and sentence segmentation, tokenization, and parsing.5
